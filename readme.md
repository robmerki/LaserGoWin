# Laser Go Win
## A project for the Vancouver Startup Week 2016 Hackathon.

### Description
A geolocation based social mobile augmented reality lottery game for iOS and Android smartphones. In the game, a player has two items: Lasers and Gems. Lasers cost $1 CDN each and are used to destroy virtual treasure chests, which have a random chance to drop either Gems or real cash. Gems are a virtual currency that allow players to powerup their Laser shots. These powerups add multipliers to a surrounding area to increase the chance that players win real cash. Other players in the area also benefit from these powerups.
