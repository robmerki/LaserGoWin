# Laser Go Win
## A project for the Vancouver Startup Week 2016 Hackathon.

### Description
A geolocation based social mobile augmented reality lottery game for iOS and Android smartphones. In the game, a player has two items: Lasers and Gems. Players must physically go to a BCLC lottery station, and then scan a BCLC logo to start. This enters players into the game session in which they have the chance to shoot at treasure chests. If a player successfully shoots a treasure chest, items will fall out and be automatically collected. Items include real world cash (in between $0.50 and $100), more Lasers, and Gems.

* *Lasers* cost $1 CDN each and are used to destroy virtual treasure chests. 
* *Gems* are a virtual currency that allow players to use powerups. 1,000 Gems activate 1 powerup.
* *Powerups* add cash multipliers to a surrounding area to increase the dropped items from treasure chests. Other players in the same geolocation also benefit from Powerups.

Powerups are meant to increase foot traffic to BCLC locations, such as Lottery Centres or Bingo Halls.
